# FQQasm

This is a set of benchmark circuit designed for fault-tolerant circuit and application.
The goal of this benchmark circuit is to test the ability of compiler and quantum hardware in the early fault-tolerant Era.



# TODO List--Small benchmark

In this small benchmark, we construct circuits for all small scale quantum error correction code memory without logical operation.

- [ ] Small codes
- [ ] Surface code
- [ ] LDPC code
- [ ] Evaluation on IBM


# TODO List--Medium benchmark

In the Medium benchmark, we construct single logical operations.

- [ ] 15-to-1 Magic state distillation
- [ ] Small codes gate sets
- [ ] Lattice surgery gate sets
- [ ] LDPC code gate sets
- [ ] Evaluation on IBM


# TODO List--Large benchmark

In the large benchmark, we construct small scale logical circuit.

- [ ] Fault-tolerant DJ algorithm with Surface/LDPC code
- [ ] Fault-tolerant Grover algorithm with Surface/LDPC code
- [ ] Fault-tolerant QAOA algorithm with Surface/LDPC code
